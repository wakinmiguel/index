      <h1>Origin</h1><br>
      <p>Welcome to Starbucks, your neighborhood coffeehouse and home of world-class coffee experiences. Since opening our first store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market in 1971, we have grown from a small coffee bean shop into a global brand, serving millions of customers in over 80 countries. What makes Starbucks unique is not just the quality of our coffee, but the heart we put into every cup—sourcing ethically grown beans, supporting farming communities, and crafting beverages that bring people comfort and joy every day.
<br><br>
At Starbucks, every visit is more than just a coffee run—it’s a moment to slow down, connect, and belong. Whether you’re enjoying your favorite espresso, exploring our seasonal beverages, or simply finding a cozy spot to study or meet with friends, our stores are designed to be your “third place” between home and work. Beyond coffee, we also offer delicious pastries, sandwiches, and teas to complement your experience.
<br><br>
We are also committed to creating a positive impact. From our sustainability initiatives to reduce waste and protect the planet, to our community programs that give back locally, Starbucks is guided by the mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time. Wherever you are, there’s always a Starbucks nearby, ready to welcome you with open doors and a freshly brewed cup.</p>
